# NOVA Rx — HANDOFF (living project state)

Last documented: 2026-11-05 (Asia/Riyadh). This document is a handoff, not proof of current CI status. Verify GitHub before making changes.

## Owner priorities and non-negotiables
- Phase 1: finish premium, responsive pharmacy POS frontend and UX. Database/backend integration comes later.
- Preserve the existing implementation and UX decisions. Never restart a task from scratch without checking saved work and explicit owner approval.
- **Kimi 2 is the default for routine UI coding, bug fixes and Playwright work; Kimi 3 only for demonstrably complex architecture or broad redesign.** This is a policy, NOT a verified statement of the currently configured runtime model.
- Kimi quota is precious: minimal file reads, narrow scope, small batches, no repetitive repo audits or unnecessary agent calls/tests.
- Keep credentials in secrets; never commit tokens, passwords, or keys.
- Do not merge or deploy without the established review/approval workflow.

## Current project context (verify live before acting)
- Repository: elsousypharmacy-create/nova-rx.
- Existing README describes desktop POS prototype, 72/28 invoice/customer layout, keyboard-first search, discounts and checkout.
- Active work tracked by issue #4: [Kimi TASK 002] remaining Grok-confirmed POS UX defects in batches. Areas: label panel blocking next sale, language switching/i18n, mobile FAB overlap, empty search, discount feedback, AI retry, product filter empty state, and smaller UX fixes.
- Workflow run 42033433619 had failed on a Kimi 5-hour quota limit, then its failed job was rerun. Rerun creates a new runner/session; uncommitted work from the failed runner is not automatically preserved. At last verification, the rerun's implementation step was in progress. **This is historical status, not a live claim.**
- Prior completed work includes issue #2 / PR #3, reportedly merged at commit 236dba1281972f99a0845e5e617c5d2bdefa0129. Verify current branches/PRs/commits before assuming a task is unfinished.

## Required agent protocol — ALL AI agents (ChatGPT, Kimi, Grok, others)
1. At start, read this HANDOFF.md and check current issue, branch, PR, commits, and CI status. Do not duplicate completed work.
2. Before work, state exact narrow scope, files to touch, expected result and token-conscious plan. Avoid broad exploratory reads.
3. **Every meaningful progress checkpoint must be written to HANDOFF.md and committed/pushed to GitHub**, including: completed work, changed files, commit/branch/PR links, tests and results, remaining work, blockers, next exact action. Update before handing off, stopping, or hitting limits whenever possible.
4. If a task fails, times out, or hits quota, inspect commits/PR/checkpoints FIRST. Never rerun failed workflow jobs automatically. Ask owner before any potentially expensive restart.
5. Keep handoff updates factual and concise; distinguish verified facts from plans. Do not claim a commit or test passed unless confirmed.
6. Coordinate handoff edits carefully: fetch latest before writing, avoid overwriting another agent's updates; use separate branch/PR if concurrent edits conflict.

## Latest human decision
Owner explicitly requires **all AI-agent prompts/instructions to require writing progress to HANDOFF.md**. Kimi 2 default, Kimi 3 reserved for complex tasks. Protect Kimi usage and avoid repeating work.

## Next action
Verify latest state of issue #4, run 42033433619, and associated branches/PRs. Do not trigger a run merely to check. Continue only unfinished work from verified checkpoint.

## Agent checkpoint log
- 2026-11-05 — ChatGPT: Created project handoff and agent-wide checkpoint policy. No Kimi execution was started by this documentation change.

## Verified checkpoint — 2026-11-06 00:xx Asia/Riyadh (ChatGPT)
Source: owner-provided detailed 2026-11-05 chat handoff, cross-checked with GitHub PR #6, QA branch, and Cloudflare API. Treat owner handoff as context, not automatic proof of testing.

### Project and release separation
- NOVA Rx only: elsousypharmacy-create/nova-rx. Pharmacy dashboard elsousypharmacy-create/pharmacy is separate; do not mix.
- Live site: https://nova-rx-preview.elsousypharmacy.workers.dev/ on Cloudflare Worker nova-rx-preview. GitHub merge does NOT automatically imply Cloudflare deployment.
- Latest Cloudflare deployment observed via API: 2026-11-05T20:52:19.623635Z, deployment eb64f58a-825a-455d-b48c-96c2bdb9ff8a, version dbca6f13-6d77-4cdc-bdbd-d3ccc3cd43ff (100%). Prior deployment at 20:25:10Z. Content equivalence to GitHub and functional QA NOT verified. Do not assume latest deployment is the earlier labels-only fix.
- Cloudflare settings and secrets endpoints confirm GEMINI_API_KEY exists as secret_text. AI function is NOT verified; owner reports waiting then Arabic error 'تعذر توليد التعليمات' after retry. Diagnose without exposing secret.
- PR #6 merged into main as 4720ed801ada4d27cb95496d5ac44eaba34a2d56, addressing ONLY UX-LABELS-PANEL-BLOCKS-NEXT-SALE; Kimi reported 10/10 targeted and 21/21 regression tests. Independent live-browser QA remains unverified.
- PR #3 merged as 236dba1281972f99a0845e5e617c5d2bdefa0129 for issue #2. Grok's QA on earlier 85b8209 rated 64/100 and accepted five issue #2 fixes. qa/reports branch STATUS.md and QA_REPORT.md are STALE for latest deployment; do not treat them as current verification.
- Issue #4 still tracks remaining UX fixes; issue #7 tracks shared durable handoff/history. Do not rerun Kimi before checking progress and quota.

### Product priorities and UX owner decisions
- Phase 1 only: premium Black Edition, Arabic RTL, landscape-first desktop/tablet POS with responsive mobile. UX must be fast, uncluttered, coherent; no database/backend phase yet.
- NEXT and review/print-sticker flow: review confirmation next to print at final step, print gated until review; clear reload for AI failure; entered medicines survive refresh; no redundant helper lines, distracting green dot or poor-direction arrows.
- Remaining defects to verify on live deployed version: mixed languages, weak language switch, RTL, mobile FAB collision, empty search/filter states, discount feedback, AI retry, toasts, and navigation. No assumption that all are still present without testing.
- Agent responsibilities: ChatGPT plan/review/merge/deploy/verify; Kimi narrow coding with low token usage; Grok browser-only UX QA on exact deployed build; GitHub Actions Playwright. Flow: Kimi → ChatGPT review → merge → Cloudflare deploy → Grok browser QA → report → next batch.
- Roadmap: 1 UX/POS; 2 persistent database; 3 operations/admin; 4 expanded AI/automation; 5 commercial readiness. These are planned phases, not implemented claims.

### Next actions
1. Inspect latest Cloudflare deployment content and safely compare with GitHub; preserve Worker AI route/bindings and rollback.
2. Diagnose Gemini AI generation failure with actual response/log evidence; do not request key from owner.
3. Browser-test latest deployed version, including next-sale/labels and landscape UX, then prioritize only remaining defects.
4. Keep HANDOFF.md concise and add dated decisions/history under docs/; every agent must record tested/merged/deployed distinctions before handoff.

### Documentation discrepancy
The earlier 'Next action' above refers to issue #4 run 42033433619 and predates merged PR #6 and the Cloudflare deployments. This checkpoint supersedes that historical next action; preserve it only for audit history.
